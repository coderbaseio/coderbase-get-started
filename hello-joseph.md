### A bit about me.

If you laughed at that, you might be similar to me. I love Computer Science and cannot find enough time to fill my life with all the projects floating in my head. I first became interested in programming when I found out that you can make GUIs and write small Visual Basic programs in Word. I immediately started learning the language and hacking my way through it. I made a small program that searched through Windows' Registery to find keys which looked like Malware. Oh the fun I had.

I am now persuing a Masters of Science in Computer Science at Arizona State University. I primarily work in Body Sensor Networks; programming sensors to collect ECG and EEG and process the data to do something fun with. For example, you can check out [Cerebral Academy](http://www.coderbase.io/majora2007/CerebralAcademy) where I use EEG signals to push, pull, and lift 3D objects to solve puzzles. 

I am always open to learning new technologies or concepts and love reading code, especially open source libraries and learn how they work. I hope to post interesting challenges or just plain ol' funny codes that I come accross.


### Me outside of CS


Without Computer Science, I enjoy gardening, hiking, DIY projects, cooking, and Brainwave Entrainment. I'm really passionate about cooking, well my friends would say "experimenting" as I love seeing what new things I can come up with. I am also actively using and developing Brainwave Entrainment sessions. Brainwave Entrainment is a phenonomon where oscillating stimulii cause your brainwaves to begin oscillating at the same frequency. Using different frequencies, certain disorders can be targeted and with repeated use, the brain can learn to overcome these problems.
