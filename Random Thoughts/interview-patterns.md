summary: My frustration with Interviewers and their questions about Design Patterns
---

I'm frustrated. I am currently on the job hunt and I keep running into interviewers requiring "knowledge of design patterns". Seeing this my heart skips a beat and I get super excited to talk to someone about design patterns. My friends no longer listen, let alone discuss them with me anymore.

But what I've found is interviewers don't want to alk about design patterns; they want to talk about Singleton and Abstract Factory. I'm frustrated. These two patterns are the simplest and are a kick in the face to someone who enjoys patterns. What about Builder, Proxy, Command, Composite, Decorator, Object Pool, and the many more?

Just knowing Singleton (which is becoming more of an anti-pattern due to using it as a global variable holder) and Abstract Pattern basically says, *yeah, I studdied those in school and used them a few times.* 

I hope I can get an interview question where they ask something fun (read: challenging) where I have to put my pattern knowledge to the test.
